## First Time Installation

```shell
npm install
npm run prepare
npm run build:dev
```

If you are on a Mac:
```shell
chmod ug+x .husky/*
chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
```

## Local

Local development should be done with: `npm run dev`

The client will automatically launch connecting to World 1.
Local world is hosted on World 0.
You have the ability to connect to live servers from the local client by changing the param.

http://localhost:8080/?world=0&detail=high&method=0

This is not to be confused with the Java TeaVM client which is hosted here if the local server is running:

http://localhost/client?world=0&detail=high&method=0
