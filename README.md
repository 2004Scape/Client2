## First Time Installation

```shell
npm install
npm run prepare
npm run build:dev
```

If you are on a Mac:
```shell
chmod ug+x .husky/*
chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
```

## Local

Local development should be done with: `npm run dev`

The client will automatically launch connecting to World 1.
Local world is hosted on World 0.
You have the ability to connect to live servers from the local client by changing the param.

http://localhost:8080/?world=0&detail=high&method=0 (TypeScript)

This is not to be confused with the Java TeaVM client which is hosted here if the local server is running:

http://localhost/client?world=0&detail=high&method=0 (Java)

## Web Worker server and WebRTC peer to peer connections

A web worker server will start when loading world 999. This works as a no install, offline, singleplayer version of the server. You will need to self host in order to load saves.

How to use:
1. Run `npm run build` and then `npm run bundle` in the server, this copies all required files to `../Client2/public`.
2. A save dialog will open on logout, you should save to `/public/data/players`.
3. Optional: To host on github uncomment the lines starting with `!/public` marks in the [.gitignore](.gitignore).

Combined with WebRTC connections you'll be able to host servers using just your browser by manually exchanging a message for each peer. Players that want to join will have to be on world 998 which won't start a web worker server.

Clicking `New user` on login screen or additionally `::peer` ingame for hosts will open a prompt and write either an offer (host) or answer (peer) to clipboard automatically. This message will contain your public IP. Pass the offer to the peer, peer returns the answer and you'll be connected! Closing the prompt will reset the process and allows for any amount of peers.
